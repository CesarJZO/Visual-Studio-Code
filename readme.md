# Visual Studio Code

In this repository, I will place all the configurations I use to set on different projects depending on the language and the framework. This will be useful until I figure out how to make my own extension.

## Languages

- [C#](C#.md)
- [C](C.md)

## Frameworks

- [Unity](Unity.md)

## Miscellaneous

- [Fonts](fonts.md)
